# github-markup tool
#
# Used for converting any markup content on github (such as markdown, RST,
# and others) to HTML.
#
# We install it from source and not from the Ubuntu repository to get the
# newest version which is also used on GitHub itself, avoiding rendering
# differences as much as we can.
