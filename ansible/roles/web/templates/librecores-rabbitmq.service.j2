Description=LibreCores RabbitMQ
Requires=rabbitmq-server.service
After=rabbitmq-server.service

{#
In the Vagrant-based development environment, the file systems holding our
configuration (e.g. EnvironmentFile) and code must be available before this
service can be started. Not checking for this causes a couple of failed start
attempts of this unit, effectively leaving it in disabled state until the VM
is restarted or the unit is manually started.
PartOf takes care to restart this service together with the NFS client, i.e.
if the connectivity to the host changes.
