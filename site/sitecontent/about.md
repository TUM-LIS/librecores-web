# About LibreCores

LibreCores is your gateway to free and open source digital designs and other components that you can use and re-use in your digital designs.
Towards this goal, LibreCores provides you

- a comprehensive and easy directory of digital design components ("IP Cores"),
- means to assess the quality of those components, and
- documentation to learn more about the use and contribution to free and open source digital designs.

LibreCores is a project of the [Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation](http://www.fossi-foundation.org), short FOSSi.
